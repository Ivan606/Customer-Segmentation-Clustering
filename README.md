This notebook aims at analyzing the content of an E-commerce database that lists about half million transactions made by âˆ¼4000 customers  over a period of one year (from 2010/12/01 to 2011/12/09).

The objective here is to understand customers behavior by digging insight from their transcation data. Also, classifying clients into segments/clusters so the marketing team can target and push the right offers to the corresponding clients.
